	Implement Recommend(SELLERS, PRODUCTS, n_sellers, n_products, product) function. The function should 
	search and print information about the seller who is selling the product (i.e., the search string) at the 
	lowest Price.  The following rules must be obeyed:

    Rule 1. Only sellers with a rating of at least 3.0 are qualified to be considered for recommendation.
              
	Rule 2. Tie-Breakers:
			  	
			Q1: What if there are two or more sellers selling the same product for the same price?  
			A1: It is the seller with the highest Rating who is recommended.  We value more Trustworthy people! 

			Q2: What if the situation above happens, and the sellers have the same rating? 
			A2: It is the seller with the smallest ID number (the lower the number, the more senior is the seller 
	    		in the community) who is recommended. We respect people who are more senior than us!

    You are allowed to define other functions that you can call inside Recommend().
			  
  	HARD REQUIREMENTS: 
	1. you must call Linear_Search() inside Recommend().
	 
	2. You must strictly follow the same output format described below.
	   a. If the product is found, the output is in the following sequence:
	   
	      product	price	ID	firstname	lastname	rating 
	   
	   b. If the item is not found, the output should be:
	   	     
	       product NONE
	   
	   
	   c. Use printf() to output the required values separated by a tab character, i.e. '\t'.  
	   	  Print floating point values with two digits after the decimal point.
		   
	3. DO NOT print any other unnecessary string or value.  It will interfere with the black box test!!!
	   
	View the contents of the file EXPECTED.txt for the sample expected output when the given main() function is executed.
