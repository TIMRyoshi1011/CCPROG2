	Q1: Is the word <param_str> in the list? 

	This is a searching problem.  The function should return 1 to mean "Yes, the word being searched
	is in the list", otherwise, it should return 0 to mean "No, it is not in the list".
	
	The example INCOMPLETE function definition below shows the appropriate return data type (int), 
	a function name and the necessary parameters to compute the answer to the question.  
	
	The param_str represents a function parameter (in this case the search key, i.e., the 
	word to search).  It is given as the third parameter in the function definition.
	
	An example function call would be: result = Search(WordList, NUM_SIZE, "program"); 
	where result is an int variable
	
	You must fill in the body of the function. DO NOT forget a return statement!

	Q6 (BONUS QUESTION): What is the longest word?   
	
	The function should return the memory address where the longest word is stored in the WordList.
	This means that the function return type is char *.
	
	Note: you should NOT manually search for this word. You have to implement the function
	that will search this word.
